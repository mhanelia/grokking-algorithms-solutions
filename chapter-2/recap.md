# Recap

- The memory of your computer is like a giant set of drawers.
- When you want to store multiple elements, you use an array or a list.
- In an array, all elements are stored next to each other.
- In a list, elements are scattered, and one element stores the address of the next element.
- Arrays allow for quick reads.
- Linked lists allow for fast insertions and deletions.
- All elements in an array must be of the same type (all ints, all doubles, and so on).
