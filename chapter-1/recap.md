# Recap

- Binary search is much faster than linear search.
- O(log n) is faster than O(n), and O(\log n) becomes even faster as the elements in the list increase.
- The speed of an algorithm is not measured in seconds.
- The runtime of an algorithm is measured through its growth.
- The runtime of algorithms is expressed in Big O notation.
