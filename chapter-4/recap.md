# Recap

- The DC strategy works by dividing the problem into smaller problems. If you are using DC on a list, the base case will likely be an empty array or an array with only one element.

- If you are implementing quicksort, choose a random element as the pivot. The average runtime of quicksort is O(n log n)!

- The constant, in Big O notation, can be relevant in some cases. This is why quicksort is faster than merge sort.

- The constant is hardly relevant in the comparison between linear search and binary search, as O(log n) is much faster than O(n) when your list is large.
